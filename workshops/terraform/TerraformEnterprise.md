## Terraform Enterprise

[Terraform Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform) extends the standard Terraform capabilities and workflow to provider a richer set of functionality.  It is well suited to enterprise environments that require more collaboration and governance features.

Key features:

* Self service workflow
* Collaboration for teams
* Powerful ACLs and auditing
* Runs Terraform for you from the browser GUI
* Control the Terraform version in line with your versioned providers and Terraform files
* Prevent concurrent changes
* Integrate with SCM platforms (e.g. GitHub, BitBucket, GitLabs)
* View history of changes
* Enforce policies with [Sentinel](https://www.hashicorp.com/sentinel)

This video shows some of the key concepts, including the forking of environments from standard definitions, embedded customer environment variables, etc.
