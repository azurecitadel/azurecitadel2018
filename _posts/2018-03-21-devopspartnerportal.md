For partners specialising on DevOps and the various CI/CD pipelines that integrate beautifully with Azure then sign up for the [DevOps partner portal](https://devopsms.com/partner).

The sign up is for MPN partners that are also Microsoft DevOps partners.  Microsoft full time employees may also request access.

There is a huge amount of content linked to from the portal.  The business level content includes case studies, Airlift materials, practice development and much more.  There is also some real technical depth available on here as well.

And don't forget some of the devops resources we have for you on the Citadel site, in videos, workshops and labs.
